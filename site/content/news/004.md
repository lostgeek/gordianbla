One of the big milestones is reached: gordianbla.de now features user accounts!

<!--more-->

First off: You can continue to use the web page as you are used to.
Local user accounts will always be the default option and stay fully supported.

If you choose to use a server-side user account, you can now easily synchronise your stats across multiple devices.
To enable this feature, visit the [settings](/settings) page and under "Account Synchronisation" create a new user account.
You can then link your other devices by creating an invite link on your main account and visiting that link on your other device (e.g. mobile phone).

The next step for the site will be the addition of global and private leaderboards that you can opt-in.
Stay tuned for that update in the near future!
