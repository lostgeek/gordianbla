While the previous version worked just fine (for the most part...), its foundation was hacked together over a weekend and I have been putting off rewriting it... until now!
<!--more-->

The new website should look and feel mostly like the old one. Your old stats should auto-import. If they for some reason do not, please try the button in the Settings tab.

I have implemented all previous features and added some new ones:

 - Practice mode is now separated into formats. Besides the previous default _Eternal_, you can now also select _Standard_, _Neo (All-NSG)_, and _Startup_.
 - Terminal Directive Campaign cards still appear, but are not separated into A, B, 2, 3, etc. anymore.
 - A rules explanation is available and automatically opens on your first visit.
 - Reduced animation settings of your OS are now respected.
 - Editing of the statistics page
 - This news page to inform you about new features

If you encounter bugs or have feature requests, please leave them at the project's [github page](https://github.com/lostgeek/gordianbla).

With the rewrite now complete, I have some exciting ideas to implement in the future. Stay tuned for updates and I hope you continue having fun with the puzzles!
